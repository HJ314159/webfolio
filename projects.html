                    <h4>To-do list is a simple web application designed for managing tasks. It offers the following features:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adding tasks</li>
                        <li>Deleting tasks</li>
                        <li>Changing the theme of the website</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To-do list allows users to add tasks and automatically saves them in local storage, ensuring that users can access their tasks even if the browser is closed.</p>
        
                    <p>Users can mark tasks as "done" to track their progress effectively.</p>
        
                    <p>The application provides a choice of six themes, including the default white theme, blue, green, orange, grey, pink</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Ensuring the web application's responsiveness on various devices.</li>
                        <li>Integrating local storage to save and retrieve tasks, making them accessible even after browser sessions.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This project taught me a bunch about making things look good on any screen, and it was pretty cool to learn.</p>

                    <p>
                        The to-do list project was a fantastic way for me to hone my web development skills and dive 
                        into creating a practical application. While there won't be any further updates to this particular project, 
                        it's just the beginning of my journey. My goal is to tackle more complex web applications in the future, 
                        each one pushing the boundaries of what I can do with code.

                    <p>Fortunately, I managed to resolve all these issues (albeit with some frustrating moments) to shape the project into what it is today.</p>

                        One exciting addition I've got in mind is implementing a formidable AI opponent. This feature will level up the single-player mode, 
                        adding a fun challenge while allowing me to delve into AI and machine learning within the realm of web development.
                        I envision an AI opponent that can adapt to the player's moves and provide a truly immersive gaming experience.

                    <p>
                        Of course, I can't deny that there's a learning curve ahead. However, 
                        I'm genuinely enthusiastic about embarking on this learning journey and incorporating this AI feature as it combines both of my interests. 
                        It's an opportunity to expand my skill set, and I'm looking forward to tackling the challenges that come with it.
